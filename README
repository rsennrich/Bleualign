GENERAL INFO
------------------

Bleualign is a tool to align parallel texts (i.e. a text and its translation) on a sentence level.
Additionally to the source and target text, Bleualign requires an automatic translation of at least one of the texts.
The alignment is then performed on the basis of the similarity (modified BLEU score) between the source text sentences (translated into the target language) and the target text sentences.
See section PUBLICATIONS for more details.

Obtaining an automatic translation is up to the user. The only requirement is that the translation must correspond line-by-line to the source text (no line breaks inserted or removed).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The software was developed on Linux using Python 2.6, but should also support newer versions of Python (including 3.X) and other platforms.
Please report any issues you encounter to sennrich@cl.uzh.ch


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

The input and output formats of bleualign are one sentence per line.
A line which only contains .EOA is considered a hard delimiter (end of article).
Sentence alignment does not cross these delimiters: reliable delimiters improve speed and performance, wrong ones will seriously degrade performance.

Given the files sourcetext.txt, targettext.txt and sourcetranslation.txt (the latter being sentence-aligned with sourcetext.txt), a sample call is

./bleualign.py -s sourcetext.txt -t targettext.txt --srctotarget sourcetranslation.txt -o outputfile

It is also possible to provide several translations and/or translations in the other translation direction.
bleualign will run once per translation provided, the final output being the intersection of the individual runs (i.e. sentence pairs produced in each individual run).

./bleualign.py -s sourcetext.txt -t targettext.txt --srctotarget sourcetranslation1.txt --srctotarget sourcetranslation2.txt --targettosrc targettranslation1.txt -o outputfile

./bleualign.py -h will show more usage options
